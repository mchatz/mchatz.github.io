## About

human. (you, too?!?!)

By day, I'm a developer turned engineering manager working on all things quality at <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. By night, you'll find me studying patterns, systems, music, technology (ancient and modern), and connections across disciplines. And of course, living my best cool mom life. ðŸ˜‰
